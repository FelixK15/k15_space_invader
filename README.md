## About ##

K15 Space Invaders is a clone of the popular space invaders games.

The games was made during an 48 hour game jam at my university and
was made using my own 2D game engine, the [K15 Engine](https://bitbucket.org/FelixK15/k15-engine).

## How to build ##

The project comes with pre-built binaries and project files for Visual Studio 2010.
If you want to build the project from scratch, you also have to provide the library
for the K15 Engine (which you can also build from scratch).

If you want to build the project with another version of Visual Studio, you'll also need
to provide a version of the K15 Engine build with that version.
